# Daily-notes

It's cost me quite a little bit long time to started this coding-with-note stuff. Before I am getting here...wait, I need to calculate how far I have gone without taking notes:

Let me think...
- I do have somet knowledge with baic syntax of JAVA
- A little bit collection concept, like Arraylist and his happy partner(LinkedList etc.)
- Very basic practice of Servlet/JSP
- Using SQL for query something, and JDBC setting experience.
